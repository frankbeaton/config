# 'matching' - was the default, but can be "dangerous" since it'd push all
#              matching branches.
# 'upstream' - push the current branch to its upstream branch. With this, git
#              push will update the same remote ref as the one which is merged
#              by git pull, making push and pull symmetrical.
# 'simple'   - like upstream, but refuses to push if the upstream branch's name
# introduced:  is different from the local one. This is the safest option and
# v1.7.11.     is well-suited for beginners. It will become the default in Git
#              2.0.
